        Lovesickness refers to an affliction that can produce negative feelings when deeply in love, during the absence of a loved one or when love is unrequited.
<br><br>
The term "lovesickness" is rarely used in modern medicine and psychology, though new research is emerging on the impact of heartbreak on the body and mind.[1]
<br><br>
In 1915, Sigmund Freud asked rhetorically, "Isn't what we mean by 'falling in love' a kind of sickness and craziness, an illusion, a blindness to what the loved person is really like?"[9]
<br><br>
Scientific study on the topic of lovesickness has found that those in love experience a kind of high similar to that caused by illicit drugs such as cocaine. In the brain, certain neurotransmitters — phenethylamine, dopamine, norepinephrine and oxytocin — elicit the feeling of high from "love" or "falling in love" using twelve different regions of the brain. These neurotransmitters mimic the feeling of amphetamines.[10]
<br><br>
On average, a psychologist does not get referrals from general practitioners mentioning "lovesickness", although this can be prevalent through the language of what the patient feels. With the common symptoms of lovesickness being related to other mental diseases, it is often misdiagnosed or it is found that with all the illnesses one could be facing, love is the underlying problem.[11] This is incredibly dangerous when one does not seek help or cannot cope because love has been known to be fatal (a consequence of which might be attempted suicide, thus dramatising the ancient contention that love can be fatal).[12]
<br><br>
In his book The Social Nature of Mental Illness, Len Bowers postulates that although physiological differences exist in the brain of those that are deemed "mentally ill," there are several other criteria that must be met before the differences can be called a malfunction. It is possible, therefore, that many mental illnesses (such as lovesickness), will never bear strong enough evidence to clinically warrant 'legitimate' affliction by clinical-standards; without further, correspondingly parasympathetic, criteria of established dysfunction(s).
<br><br>
Frank Tallis, a researcher of love and lovesickness, suggests in his 2005 article that lovesickness occurs when one is "truly, madly, deeply" in love and should be taken more seriously by medical professionals.[12]
<br><br>
Tallis includes a list of common symptoms of lovesickness:
<br><br>
Mania - an abnormally elevated mood or inflated self-esteem
<br><br>
Depression, hopelessness, or helplessness
<br><br>
Nausea
<br><br>
Tearfulness
<br><br>
Insomnia, which may lead to fatigue
<br><br>
Lack of concentration
<br><br>
Loss of appetite or overeating
<br><br>
Stress
<br><br>
Obsessive-compulsive disorder - preoccupation and hoarding valueless but superstitiously 
resonant items <br><br>
Dizziness and confusion
<br><br>
Body tremors, intrusive thoughts, frequent flashbacks.
<br><br>
Mood swings
<br><br>
According to Tallis, many symptoms of lovesickness can be categorized under the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a symptom of lovesickness because it includes a preoccupation. This would include constantly checking one's cellphone.[12] A further study conducted by Italian Psychiatrist Donatella Marazitti found that people who fall in love have their serotonin levels drop to levels found in patients with OCD. This level is significantly lower than that of an average or healthy person.[13]</div>
